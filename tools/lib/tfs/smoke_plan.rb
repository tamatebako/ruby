module Tfs
  # The compile-smoke leg plan (release-src's publish gate): one
  # representative leg per (changed line x affected scenario) at the
  # line's NEWEST version, computing from the same Tfs::ReleaseDiff the
  # build/copy plan uses.
  #
  # Two fault-isolation axes, both from the diff:
  #
  # * line: only lines whose patch set changed smoke at all;
  # * scenario: only the scenarios the changed patches FEED smoke
  #   (Tfs::ReleaseDiff#changed_scenarios — an msys patch never smokes
  #   linux). A line whose attribution is explicitly empty (a darwin-only
  #   change — no shipped scenario) smokes nothing.
  #
  # A line-wide patch set means a representative leg per (line, scenario)
  # covers the changed translation units; per-version legs would multiply
  # configure runs for no extra signal. msys legs compile at pass 2 (the
  # pass split selects GNUmakefile variants — no patched .c differs
  # between passes).
